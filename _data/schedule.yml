      topic: "Career and Research Opportunities in Product: My experience working on the Google Assistant"
      abstract: "In this talk I'll cover my experience of identifying and developing research opportunities in a product focused environment where often the top priority is user satisfaction. How do we identify research problems? How do we align them to our goal of improving user satisfaction? How can we build a career while working on products? These are some of the topics that we'll touch upon in this talk."

      topic: Story behind the First NLP System Named After a Children's TV Star to Win a Best Paper
      abstract: "In this talk, I will share the story behind ELMo - the first NLP system named after a children's TV star to win a best paper - and some of the lessons learned along the way that have heavily influenced my research in the years since.  When I started the project I had no formal training in computer science, machine learning, or NLP, and only a strong intuition that a language model would provide a universally good starting point for any language task.  It took over a year with many dead ends and failed experiments during which I considered abandoning the project multiple times.  Through this process I learned many things, but most importantly the value of the willingness to fail and maintaining a methodological approach when pursuing high risk projects."

      topic: Building Datasets for the Analysis of Culture
      abstract: Much work at the intersection of NLP and computational social science/cultural analytics focuses on developing algorithmic measuring devices that can be seen as counting some phenomenon in text in order to tell us something about the world in which that text was created.  The instrument validity of those devices in critical; and while advances in large language modeling and domain adaptation have enabled models trained on one domain to generalize (to some extent) to another, what is often required is a model optimized for that domain being studied, and the specific phenomena that are being measured within it.  In this talk, I'll discuss my own group's work creating annotated datasets for the study of culture, including both contemporary novels and movies, highlighting a number of the practical, legal and conceptual challenges that arise.

      topic: My Journey in NLP
      abstract: In this talk, Zhijing Jin (she/her) will share about her PhD journey in NLP with stories and lessons learned. Her talk will be friendly to audiences of all backgrounds, from beginners in NLP to senior researchers. She will address common career path questions such as “how to get started in NLP?”, “How to do well in a PhD”, and “What is a meaningful career”. The talk will cover her personal stories, research pursuit (NLP for Social Good and CausalNLP), and community contributions (ACL Year-Round Mentorship, etc). [The talk slides are available here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-njz5uwBhi5j1iqkDheyCJ07mtsyMUBTqZFtPDQpSHs/).

      topic: Serendipity tales of a Mexican NLP Gal
      abstract: Everyone has challenges to overcome, some have already experienced what would be the most difficult obstacles life had in store for them, while for others there is still a hard road ahead. My life is no exception, in the pursuit of my career goals I’ve faced some obstacles that I’ll share in this talk. But I want to focus on the little happy coincidences in my professional life that have had a significant impact on myself, at the professional and at the personal level. I will also share how some of my personal life has influenced my research curiosity and motivated my research agenda through the years. Lastly, if I have time, I’ll share my perspective on the always controversial notion of “life-work” balance.

      topic: Improving Papers through Self-editing
      abstract: "Few of us really like writing papers. And few of us are really very good at it. To this end, ACL Student Research Workshops now commonly run a _Pre-submission Mentorship Program_ that gives students the chance to receive feedback on their papers before submitting them for review. The feedback comes from experienced members of the field, in the form of suggestions for improve the paper's overall organization and writing.  It is a program that is of clear benefit to participant. But what if such a program isn't on offer?  What then? Early in my career, I learned to pretend that a paper I was working on had been written by someone else -- someone who was too caught up in the paper to see its shortcomings. This _let's pretend_ of self-editing will be my contribution to Stories Shared and Lessons Learned."

      topic: Lessons Learned from Interdisciplinary Collaboration
      abstract: I care about building NLP technologies that can help real-world practitioners gain insights from text, which means I have had the opportunity to collaborate with a variety of domain experts outside our field. It turns out this is really hard. In this talk I'll reflect on lessons learned from interdisciplinary collaborations, and present some related open challenges to doing great science.

      topic: Venturing Off the NLP Map into Interdisciplinary Lands
      abstract: "How does someone in NLP start doing interdisciplinary research? Venturing out from NLP to new lands can be daunting: people speak new languages, are interested in new questions, and get confused why we keep talking about Sesame Street characters. I'll share my story of going off the NLP map, switching from lexical semantics to doing research primarily in interdisciplinary settings like computational social science. Join me for tales from my journey out to these foreign locales and how I have navigated some of the challenges like finding fellow adventurers, summiting the mountains of papers, avoiding the plains of isolation, and finding treasured research problems relevant to both fields."
