        <p>In this talk, I will share the story behind ELMo - the first NLP system named after a children’s TV star to win a best paper - and some of the lessons learned along the way that have heavily influenced my research in the years since.  When I started the project I had no formal training in computer science, machine learning, or NLP, and only a strong intuition that a language model would provide a universally good starting point for any language task.  It took over a year with many dead ends and failed experiments during which I considered abandoning the project multiple times.  Through this process I learned many things, but most importantly the value of the willingness to fail and maintaining a methodological approach when pursuing high risk projects.</p>

        <p>Much work at the intersection of NLP and computational social science/cultural analytics focuses on developing algorithmic measuring devices that can be seen as counting some phenomenon in text in order to tell us something about the world in which that text was created.  The instrument validity of those devices in critical; and while advances in large language modeling and domain adaptation have enabled models trained on one domain to generalize (to some extent) to another, what is often required is a model optimized for that domain being studied, and the specific phenomena that are being measured within it.  In this talk, I’ll discuss my own group’s work creating annotated datasets for the study of culture, including both contemporary novels and movies, highlighting a number of the practical, legal and conceptual challenges that arise.</p>

My life is no exception, in the pursuit of my career goals I’ve faced some obstacles that I’ll share in this talk. But I want to focus on the little happy coincidences in my professional life that have had a significant impact on myself, at the professional and at the personal level. I will also share how some of my personal life has influenced my research curiosity and motivated my research agenda through the years. Lastly, if I have time, I’ll share my perspective on the always controversial notion of “life-work” balance.</p>

        <p>Few of us really like writing papers. And few of us are really very good at it. To this end, ACL Student Research Workshops now commonly run a <em>Pre-submission Mentorship Program</em> that gives students the chance to receive feedback on their papers before submitting them for review. The feedback comes from experienced members of the field, in the form of suggestions for improve the paper’s overall organization and writing.  It is a program that is of clear benefit to participant. But what if such a program isn’t on offer?  What then? Early in my career, I learned to pretend that a paper I was working on had been written by someone else – someone who was too caught up in the paper to see its shortcomings. This <em>let’s pretend</em> of self-editing will be my contribution to Stories Shared and Lessons Learned.</p>

        <p>How does someone in NLP start doing interdisciplinary research? Venturing out from NLP to new lands can be daunting: people speak new languages, are interested in new questions, and get confused why we keep talking about Sesame Street characters. I’ll share my story of going off the NLP map, switching from lexical semantics to doing research primarily in interdisciplinary settings like computational social science. Join me for tales from my journey out to these foreign locales and how I have navigated some of the challenges like finding fellow adventurers, summiting the mountains of papers, avoiding the plains of isolation, and finding treasured research problems relevant to both fields.</p>

          <p>Zhijing Jin is a Ph.D. at Max Planck Institute & ETH. Her research goals are two-fold: (1) to expand the impact of NLP by promoting NLP for social good, and (2) to improve NLP models by connecting NLP with causal inference. She is co-supervised by Prof Bernhard Schoelkopf at Max Planck Institute (main supervisor), Prof Rada Mihalcea at University of Michigan (as a mentor), and Prof Mrinmaya Sachan and Prof Ryan Cotterell (co-supervision through ELLIS program) at ETH Zürich. She has published at many NLP and AI venues (e.g., AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, AISTATS), and NLP for healthcare venues (e.g., AAHPM, JPSM). Her work has been cited in MIT News, ACM TechNews, WeVolver, VentureBeat, and Synced. She is actively involved in AI for social good, as the organizer of NLP for Positive Impact Workshop at ACL 2021 and EMNLP 2022, and RobustML workshop at ICLR 2021. To support the NLP research community, she organizes the ACL Year-Round Mentorship Program. To foster the causality research community, she is the Publications Chair for the 1st conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning (CLeaR), and organizes the Tutorial on CausalNLP at EMNLP 2022.
