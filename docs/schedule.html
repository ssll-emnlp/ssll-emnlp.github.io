          <p>David Bamman is an associate professor in the School of Information at UC Berkeley, where he works in the areas of natural language processing and cultural analytics, applying NLP and machine learning to empirical questions in the humanities and social sciences. His research focuses on improving the performance of NLP for underserved domains like literature (including LitBank and BookNLP) and exploring the affordances of empirical methods for the study of literature and culture. Before Berkeley, he received his PhD in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and was a senior researcher at the Perseus Project of Tufts University. Bamman's work is supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, National Science Foundation, an Amazon Research Award, and an NSF CAREER award.</p>

          <p>Zhijing Jin is a Ph.D. at Max Planck Institute & ETH. Her research goals are two-fold: (1) to expand the impact of NLP by promoting NLP for social good, and (2) to improve NLP models by connecting NLP with causal inference. She is co-supervised by Prof Bernhard Schoelkopf at Max Planck Institute (main supervisor), Prof Rada Mihalcea at University of Michigan (as a mentor), and Prof Mrinmaya Sachan and Prof Ryan Cotterell (co-supervision through ELLIS program) at ETH Zürich. She has published at many NLP and AI venues (e.g., AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, COLING, AISTATS), and NLP for healthcare venues (e.g., AAHPM, JPSM). Her work has been cited in MIT News, ACM TechNews, WeVolver, VentureBeat, and Synced. She is actively involved in AI for social good, as the organizer of NLP for Positive Impact Workshop at ACL 2021 and EMNLP 2022, and RobustML workshop at ICLR 2021. To support the NLP research community, she organizes the ACL Year-Round Mentorship Program. To foster the causality research community, she is the Publications Chair for the 1st conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning (CLeaR), and organizes the Tutorial on CausalNLP at EMNLP 2022.
